# WP Plugin Library
I wanted to make a simple library using newer PHP features so it would be easier to prototype WordPress plugins.
 
## Installation
Since Composer features autoloading and it has a great community, this is the only supported way to work with the library.
```
$ composer require cprods/wp-plugin-library:dev-master
```
